## Opposites Attract

An experiment by $$$GP4

#Purpose 

After the release of the free license for Unity, we are trying to create a game to test our skills of coding in Unity and to take our coding skills to the limit. If I can do it, then you can do it too. You can do anything if you put your mind to it. THUMBS UP FOR ROCK AND ROLL! 

#Ideas (So Far) 
1. Puzzle Game
2. Magnets 
3. Maze/Board type game? 


#Conclusion
We shall see
